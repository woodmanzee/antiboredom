<h3>Contributions</h3>
<p>Description</p>
<p>Melissa Smith: My contributions to this project included attending</p>
<p>the group meetings and helping develop the design.</p> 
<p>I added the username field to sign up. I wrote up and</p> 
<p>submitted the third milestone report. I was willing and</p> 
<p>available as much as possible.</p>

<h4>Zack Woodmansee</h4>
<p>Worked primarily with the backend, helped with some of the javascript requests
when needed. Set up the API, the JSON requests, and worked with the frontend to pass the
CSRF token so that the POST requests would be recognized. Setup and created the database and 
its tables, set up the github, hosted and posted the application to Heroku.com. Went to group
meetings, finalized the app.</p>
