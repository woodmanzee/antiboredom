BYU CS 360 Web Application Project
----------------------------------

When looking for something to do in the moment, most people turn to texting all their friends (and then sitting around hoping someone answers) or calling them one by one. Current social media doesn't really help solve this problem, as hours can be spent on "social" media without ever actually talking to another persion. 

This application helps people reach out through the internet to find their friends that are looking for things to do. A simple click of a button will allow them to see all their friends that are wanting to get together and chat in-app.
